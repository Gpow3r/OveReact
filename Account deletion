How to Delete Your Account and Information
Open the App
Launch the app on your device and log in with your username and password if you aren't already logged in.

Go to Your Profile
Navigate to your profile page by tapping on your profile icon, usually located at the bottom or top right of the screen.

Locate the Delete Option
Once on your profile page, look for the bin icon (a trash can icon) next to your profile details.

Click the Bin Icon
Tap the bin icon to initiate the account deletion process.

Confirm Your Action
A pop-up will appear asking you to confirm that you wish to delete your account. This will include all your information, such as:

Email
Username
Likes
Chat Messages
Other personal data stored on the app
Enter Your Password
For security purposes, you will be prompted to enter your account password to confirm that you are the account owner.

Final Confirmation
After entering your password, you'll see a final confirmation screen asking if you're sure about deleting your account. Please read the warning carefully, as this action cannot be undone.

Complete the Deletion
Tap Delete Account to finalize the process. Your account, including all your personal information, will be permanently deleted.

Log Out
After the account deletion, you will be logged out of the app. You will no longer be able to access your account or its data.
